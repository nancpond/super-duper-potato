Okay, here's our starting question:
Loosely inspired by a Washington Post article:
"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/the-scale-of-terrorist-attacks-around-the-world/"

and a very apt comment:
"Europe + USA doesn't even account for 1/6th the world's population, while Asia alone makes up nearly 2/3rds.
I think if this was population adjusted it would move in the correct direction.
If it was Muslim population adjusted it would look even more interesting, but I guess it is not politically correct to point that out..."

Coupled with a personal burden, which is that the Western media [and dare I say, the American public?] seem to only care when white people are hurt..

What we're wondering is, is there a difference in the frequency? intensity? destructive impact of? 'terrorism' by nation, by region of the world, by relative proportion of religious practice, by GDP, by some other factor?
This is a long term question. Today's question is simply, **does a population-adjusted or identified-as-Muslim-population-adjusted comparison of the scale of casualties in terrorist attacks look [i.e. visualized, graphic form, no tests of significance] different from the raw numbers put forth by the Washington Post?**

## Datasets

Initial data inputs necessary are information on terrorist attacks, preferably already with information about the countries in which they occurred, and global population and dominant religion data by nation. A coarse dataset at the national level will be sufficient for time being, though of course sub-national level data would reveal more.

A quick Google search points us at:

National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). (2016). Global Terrorism Database [Data file]. Retrieved from https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd on 18 July 2016.

Thanks, UMD.

Population data will be sourced from:

and ISO country codes:
https://datahub.io/dataset/iso-3166-1-alpha-2-country-codes/resource/9c3b30dd-f5f3-4bbe-a3cb-d7b2c21d66ce

```{r setup}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)

folderPath <- '/Users/Nan/dock/'

ter <- read_excel(paste0(folderPath,                      'globalterrorismdb_0616dist.xlsx')) %>%
  filter(iyear >= 1998) %>%
  select(iyear, country, region, country_txt, region_txt, nkill, nkillter)

pop_reg <- read_excel(paste0(folderPath,
                         'World Religion Dataset - National Religion Dataset.XLS'))

countryCodes <- read.csv(paste0(folderPath,
                                'iso_3166_2_countries.csv'))


```

Okay, we've got three datasets. We're going to filter everything to 1998.

```{r terFirst, echo=FALSE}
ter98 <- ter %>%
  filter(iyear >= 1998) %>%
  select(iyear, country, region, country_txt, region_txt, nkill, nkillter) %>%
  #then we want to make sure we're isolating 'innocents' deaths vs. attackers 
  mutate(nkillVictim = nkill - nkillter)

#Remove giant dataset
rm(ter)

roughTer <- ter98 %>% group_by(region_txt, iyear) %>%
  summarize(totVictims = sum(nkillVictim, na.rm = T))

ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y = totVictims, color = region_txt), data = roughTer) +
  geom_point() + theme_bw() + 
  facet_wrap(~ region_txt)

```

Pause and recall that we're looking at a brightly-colored plot of a heart-breaking number of `r sum(roughTer$totVictims)` individuals killed in terrorist attacks throughout the world.

We filter the population set to a similar place:

```{r popFilters}

majReg <- pop_reg %>%
  filter(YEAR == 2010) %>%
    select(contains('GEN'), -contains('PCT')) %>%
  mutate_all(funs(gsub(',', '', .))) %>%
  mutate_all(funs(as.numeric(.))) %>%
  colSums(., na.rm = T) %>%
  as.data.frame(.) 

majReg$Faith <- row.names(majReg)
names(majReg) <- c('subPop', 'Faith')
 
majReg <- majReg %>%
  arrange(desc(subPop)) %>%
  slice(1:5)
#This gives us the top 5 religions in the world, as of 2010

pop <- pop_reg %>%
   mutate(YEAR = gsub(',', '', YEAR)) %>%
  mutate(YEAR == as.numeric(YEAR)) %>%
   filter(YEAR == 2010) %>%
   rename(iyear = YEAR) %>%
   mutate(POP = gsub(',', '', POP)) %>%
   mutate(popNum = as.numeric(POP)) %>%
    select(iyear, one_of(majReg$Faith), ISO3, NUMISO, COUNTRY, popNum) %>%
  group_by(iyear, ISO3, NUMISO, COUNTRY) %>%
  mutate_each(funs(gsub(',', '', .))) %>%
   mutate_all(funs(as.numeric(.))) %>%
  ungroup() 

popRat <- pop %>%
  select(-iyear) %>%
  group_by(ISO3, NUMISO, COUNTRY, popNum) %>%
  mutate(chrisProp = CHRSGEN / popNum,
         islProp = ISLMGEN / popNum,
         hindProp = HINDGEN / popNum,
         syncProp = SYNCGEN / popNum,
         budProp = BUDGEN / popNum) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(country_txt = COUNTRY) 

popMerge <- popRat %>%
  left_join(ter98)

```

First we can try to approximate that Washington Post figure.
Note that we're working with annual data, not daily/monthly data, and yet the trends seem comparable. 2016 is a hard year for everyone.
```{r baseFigs}

popTab1 <- popMerge %>%
  group_by(iyear, region_txt) %>%
  summarize(totDeath = sum(nkillVictim, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(totDeathAdj = ifelse(region_txt %in% c('Western Europe',
                                             'North America'),
         totDeath, -totDeath))

ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y= totDeathAdj,
           color = region_txt), data = popTab1) + 
  geom_point() + geom_point() +
  theme_bw()

ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y= totDeathAdj,
           color = region_txt), data = popTab1) + 
  geom_point() + geom_point() +
  theme_bw() + geom_line()

```

Next, we want to population adjust this. As a percentage of national population, how many victims were there?
We're going to use the 2010 population as baseline here.

```{r popAdjust}

popAdjust <- popMerge %>%
  group_by(iyear, region_txt) %>%
  summarize(totDeath = sum(nkillVictim, na.rm = T),
            totPop = sum(popNum, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(propKilled = totDeath / totPop) %>%
  mutate(prop_of_popKilled = ifelse(region_txt %in% c('Western Europe',
                                             'North America'),
         propKilled, -propKilled))


ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y = prop_of_popKilled,
           color = region_txt), data = popAdjust) + 
  geom_point() + geom_point() +
  theme_bw()

ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y= prop_of_popKilled,
           color = region_txt), data = popAdjust) + 
  geom_point() + geom_point() +
  theme_bw() + geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ region_txt)

```
Hey look, North America has disappeared. Violence in Central America and Central Asia jumps out, and terrorism in Western Europe and North America disappears. Africa

Finally, we'll adjust for proportion of Muslim population, to answer our original question.
```{relAdjust}

iProp <- popMerge %>%
  group_by(iyear, region_txt) %>%
  mutate(totDeaths = sum(nkillVictim, na.rm = T),
         totPop = sum(popNum),
         totPopI = sum(popNum * islProp, na.rm = T),
         totDeaths_I = totDeaths / totPopI,
         scaledDeaths = totDeaths  / (1 / islProp))

ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y = scaledDeaths, color = region_txt),
       data = iProp) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw()

iPropSum <- iProp %>%
  group_by(iyear, region_txt) %>%
  summarize(scaledDeaths = mean(scaledDeaths),
            totPopI = sum(totPopI),
            meanPropI = sum(totPopI) / sum(totPop))

ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y = scaledDeaths, 
           color = region_txt,
           size = totPopI),
       data = iPropSum) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw() + 
ggtitle('Points show absolute size of Muslim population')

ggplot(aes(x = iyear, y = scaledDeaths, 
           color = region_txt,
           size = meanPropI),
       data = iPropSum) + 
  geom_point() + theme_bw() + 
ggtitle('Points show relative proportion of Muslim population')


```
